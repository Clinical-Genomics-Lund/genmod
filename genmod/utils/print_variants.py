print_variants.py

Print the variants of a file to vcf file.

There are two modes, 'vcf' or 'modified'.
If 'vcf' we expect plain vcf variants and print them as they came in.
If 'modified' the first column has been used for sorting so we skip that one.

If a outfile is provided the variants will be printed to this one.
